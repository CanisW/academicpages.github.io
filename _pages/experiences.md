## Research Experience

**Representation Learning of 3D Molecule from Physical Fields Using Deep Neural Network**  
Nov., 2018 - Present *@ DDC, SKLNBD, PKU*

- Train an auto-encoder composed majorly of convolutional and deconvolutional units on ZINC lead-like subset, supervising training with 2D fingerprints;
- Aim to develop a new fingerprinting method for 3D molecule with better performance in ligand-based virtual screening and target prediction.

**DeepScaffold: A Comprehensive Tool for Scaffold-Directed Drug Discovery Using Deep Learning**  
Aug., 2018 - June., 2019 *@ DDC, SKLNBD, PKU*

- Developed graph-based deep generative models for scaffold-based molecular derivatization;
- Demonstrated the excellent performance of the model using molecular docking.

**Discovery of Novel Inhibitors of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3$\alpha$ for Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia**  
Aug., 2017 - Dec., 2018 *@ DDC, SKLNBD, PKU*

- Identified a novel chemical series of GSK-3$\alpha$ inhibitors with excellent anti-leukemia effect;
- Elucidated the structure-activity relationship by molecular docking and dynamics simulations.

**Synthesis of Glutamylhydrazine ...**  
Jan., 2017 - Mar., 2017 *@ Dong Group, SKLNBD, PKU*

- coming soon

**Synthesis of Selenocycteine**  
July, 2016 - Jan., 2017 *@ Dong Group, SKLNBD, PKU*

- coming soon

**Synthesis of Selenoproline and Its Application to Peptide Ligation**  
July, 2015 - Aug., 2016 *@ Dong Group, SKLNBD, PKU*
