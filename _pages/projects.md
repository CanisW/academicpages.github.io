## Research Projects

**TF3P: Three-dimensional Force Fields Fingerprint Learned by Deep Capsular Network.**  
Nov. 2018 - May 2020 *Advisor: [Liangren Zhang](http://dmc.sps.bjmu.edu.cn/english_20180111164913306359/researchsupervisor/193269.htm#) @ Peking University*

- Developed a new 3D fingerprint, TF3P, using the deep capsular network;
- TF3P outperforms other fingerprints on retrieving similar targets by similar ligands.

**DeepScaffold: A Comprehensive Tool for Scaffold-Directed Drug Discovery Using Deep Learning**  
Aug. 2018 - June. 2019 *@ SKLNBD, PKU*

- Developed graph-based deep generative models for scaffold-based molecular derivatization;
- Demonstrated the excellent performance of the model using molecular docking.

**Discovery of Novel Inhibitors of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3$\alpha$ for Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia**  
Aug. 2017 - Dec. 2018 *@  SKLNBD, PKU*

- Identified a novel chemical series of GSK-3$\alpha$ inhibitors by structure-based virtual screening;
- Summarized the structure-activity relationship (SAR) by similarity search;
- Demonstrate their excellent anti-leukemia effects *in vitro*;
- Elucidated the SAR by molecular docking and dynamics simulations.

**QSAR of Acylphloroglucinol-Based Meroterpenoid Inhibitors of KSHV From *Hypericum Japonicum***  
Jan. 2018 - Mar. 2018 *@  SKLNBD, PKU*
